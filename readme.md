# ESC/POS Printer Library

A Library to control an ESC printer by an ESP32 via Bluetooth BLE

At the moment I don't have an Arduino with Bluetooth BLE, but it could easily be made compatible in the future.

## Requirements

An ESP32 board with Bluetooth BLE and an ESC Bluetooth BLE thermal printer, knowing the UUID of the service and the characteristic.

## Tested

- Chinese ESC/POS printer called "BlueTooth Printer" & ESP32-S2 super mini, ESP32-C3
